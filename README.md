# Challenge: Tabs Navigation

Jorge Palacios

## Description

### Idea

The main goal of this exercise was to comply with the challenge's requirements in terms of having a couple of screens and navigating between them using a Tab Navigator stack with two or more navigation stacks within.

It was built on top of the previous homework with a couple of improvements.

### Challenges

The same ones I had with the previous excercise, so I didn't tinker a lot but focused on the tab navigation.

Regarding the tab navigator, I wanted to implement a vertical divider but was running out of time.

## Mock

Finally, as requested, please find attached the mock.
